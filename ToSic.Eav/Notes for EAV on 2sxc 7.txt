Notes 2dm for the next version of the EAV
Background is that we can probably introduce breaking changes and clean up a bit, since compatibility is not the top priority. 



Todos

Probably rename all the *Model classes to something more like "Entity"
> probably to Data\Entity etc.
> also put all in an own class
Probably remove all dependencies to EntityFramework, as we probably don't need them since we basically need a data-dump from the DB and re-create everything in RAM
Either move interfaces to /Data (without/with folder) or move other interfaces to interfaces

PipelineDesignerControl seems to have another own token-replace. if yes, this is dangerous, must use default


What I did 2015-03-09
* Moved entitymodel
* extended it with GetBestValue(*)
* extended interface with that too
* Created BasePropertyAccess with helper format method
* Created folder PropertyAccess and moved stuff there...
* Created basepropertyaccess
* Created EntityPropertyAccess
* Created /Tokens and moved stuff
* Modified BaseTokenReplace to allow instance-specific data sources
* Modified Base-Data-Source to use the instance-specific configuration provider "In"

* adeded (untested) mechanism to extract sql parameters from SQL, auto-parse and add to sql-command (SqlDataSource)
* reviewing (untested) multiline, commented reg-ex also not touching non-tokens - this would be easy to add automated testing...

What I did 2015-03-13
* created test code - and by writing that found about 10+ bugs and fixed them
* moved ContentType to \Data
* moved everything in models.cs to \Data and split into parts
* moved 2 enums from models.cs to \Enums
