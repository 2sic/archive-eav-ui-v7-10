eav UI

Presented by [2sic](https://www.2sic.com) internet solutions in Switzerland and Liechtenstein

This is the AngularJS based UI for the powerfull EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) system based on Microsoft SQL Server. 

It's currently mainly used inside [2sxc](http://2sxc.org) ([github](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc)) for [DNN (DotNetNuke)](http://dnnsoftware.com)

We separated the UI from the server components because most people will want to contribute to the UI but won't actually understand the server. 

The UI component needs the compiled DLLs from the main EAV project
